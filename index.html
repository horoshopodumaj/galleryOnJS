                            calendar, a histogram, a skeleton, and others. The layout is adapted for
                            mobile, tablet and desktop devices. The project uses BEM methodology,

                            A restaurant with online order "Bangkok Express". The project uses a
                            ready-made layout. The use of javascript in the project made it possible
                            to implement: a carousel with goods at the top of the site, a ribbon
                            menu, a slider, loading goods from the server, dynamic filtering of the
                            list of goods. As well as a basket of goods with dynamic scrolling
                            positioning, animation, modal window and order form. The component
                            architecture makes it easy to expand the restaurant, complicate the
                            interface and structure.

                            A car leasing calculator is written in React. In each field, you can
                            enter a value either from the keyboard or using the slider. When
                            selecting a value using the slider, all numbers are recalculated
                            dynamically during the movement of the slider. Each field has a maximum
                            and minimum value — the slider restricts the user in selecting data, and
                            when entering an incorrect value from the keyboard, it is reset to the
                            nearest correct number (maximum or minimum). A request is generated by
                            the “Apply for” button, which sends all the calculator data to the
                            backend. At the moment of clicking on the button, the button is blocked
                            from being able to resend data for the duration of the request to the
                            backend, and a preloader is displayed inside the button. Inputs and
                            sliders are blocked for the time of sending.
